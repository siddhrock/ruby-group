Choose the Installation Location<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Decide where you want to place your floating shelf.<\/p><p>2. Ensure the shelf height and width are appropriate for the intended purpose.<\/p><h6><strong>2. Mark the Wall<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Use a <strong>spirit level<\/strong> to draw a straight horizontal line on the wall where the shelf will be installed.<\/p><p>2. Mark the desired positions of the floating shelf brackets on the line. For stability:<\/p><p>- Place the brackets 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) from the shelf edges.<\/p><p>- Space additional brackets evenly, depending on the shelf length.<\/p><h6><strong>3. Drill Holes for Bracket Installation<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Align a bracket with one of your marks.<\/p><p>2. Mark the screw hole locations through the bracket's mounting holes.<\/p><p>3. Using a <strong>drill bit<\/strong> appropriate for your wall type:<\/p><p>- Drill pilot holes for the screws.<\/p><p>- Insert wall plugs if required (for plaster, masonry, or brick walls).<\/p><h6><strong>4. Secure the Brackets<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Position the bracket over the drilled holes.<\/p><p>2. Use the provided screws to secure the bracket to the wall with a screwdriver or drill.<\/p><p>3. Repeat for all brackets, ensuring they are aligned and level.<\/p><h6><strong>5. Prepare the Shelf Board<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Measure and mark the positions for the bracket rods on the back edge of the shelf.<\/p><p>2. Drill holes into the back of the shelf to accommodate the rods.<\/p><p>- Use a drill bit slightly larger than the rod diameter.<\/p><p>- Drill to the depth required for a snug fit, typically around 110mm for 120mm rods.<\/p><h6><strong>6. Mount the Shelf<\/strong><\/h6><p>1. Slide the shelf onto the bracket rods, ensuring it sits flush against the wall.<\/p><p>2. Confirm the shelf is level and adjust if needed.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f3f5f6","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_with_text_HhfDgq":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/file_3.jpg","image_link":"","image_size":"30","image_position":"left","title":"Tip","text":"<p>For <strong>heavy loads<\/strong>, ensure the wall and mounting method can support the weight.
