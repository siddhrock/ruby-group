Are you opting for a single gate or a double gate? Consider the style, size, and material. <strong>Scandinavian Redwood gates<\/strong> from Ruby UK are a popular choice, offering natural beauty, durability, and resistance to the elements.<\/p><p>Our redwood gates are crafted from <strong>Joinery Grade Scandinavian Redwood<\/strong>, enhanced with <strong>tanalith pressure treatment<\/strong>. This treatment ensures long-lasting protection against rot, insect damage, and UV exposure, making them ideal for outdoor use.<\/p><p>Accurate measurements of your gate opening are critical. Measure the width and height to ensure a perfect fit and to avoid complications during installation.<\/p><p><\/p><h3>Step 2: Gathering Tools and Materials<\/h3><p>Having the right tools and materials on hand will make the installation process smoother. Here’s a checklist to get you started:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Spirit level<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Tape measure<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Post hole digger<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Spanners<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Drill<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Concrete mix<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Safety gear<\/strong> (gloves, goggles)<\/li><\/ul>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"featured_collection_KFyt7D":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Get protected","enlarge_title":false,"link_text":"Shop Osmo UV Protection Oil Now","collection":"osmo-cladding-stains","show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":3,"row_count":1,"grid_mobile":"2"}},"rich_text_V8Dhpa":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"","text":"<h2><strong>Step 3: Surface prep<\/strong><\/h2><p>Mark out the gate installation area and ensure the ground is level. If the ground is uneven, use a rake or shovel to level it out. Precise markings help ensure your gate is straight and symmetrical once installed.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 4: Install the Gate Posts<\/strong><\/h2><h3>Dig Post Holes<\/h3><ul><li>Use a post hole digger to create holes that are <strong>one-third the height of your gate posts<\/strong>.<\/li><li>This depth ensures the posts can support the weight of the gate and withstand adverse weather conditions.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Set the Posts<\/h3><ul><li>Mix and pour concrete into the holes, then position the posts.<\/li><li>Use a <strong>spirit level<\/strong> to ensure the posts are perfectly vertical.<\/li><li>Brace the posts with timber supports to hold them steady while the concrete cures.<\/li><li>Allow the concrete to cure for <strong>at least 24 hours<\/strong> before proceeding.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Step 5: Hang the Gate<\/strong><\/h2><p>With the posts secure, it’s time to hang the gate. Precision is key to ensure the gate operates smoothly.<\/p><h3>Attach Hinges<\/h3><ul><li>Lay the gate flat and position the hinges, ensuring they are spaced evenly from the top and bottom edges.<\/li><li>Mark the drill points on the gate and drill <strong>pilot holes<\/strong> to prevent splitting.<\/li><li>Secure the hinges to the gate with screws.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Secure the Gate to the Posts<\/h3><ul><li>With the help of a second person or props, lift the gate into position against the posts.<\/li><li>Align the hinges with the post and mark the drill points.<\/li><li>Drill <strong>pilot holes<\/strong> into the post and secure the hinges with screws or bolts.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Align and Balance<\/h3><ul><li>Use a <strong>spirit level<\/strong> to check that the gate is level when closed.<\/li><li>If adjustments are needed, loosen the hinge screws, reposition the gate, and retighten.<\/li><li>Test the gate by opening and closing it to ensure smooth operation without dragging or sticking.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Step 6: Add Finishing Touches<\/strong><\/h2><p>Now it’s time to finalize your gate installation with added functionality and protection.<\/p><h3>Install Latches and Locks<\/h3><ul><li>Choose a latch or lock that meets your security needs, such as drop latches, bolt locks, or keyed locks.<\/li><li>Align the latch with the gate and post, mark the drill points, and secure it with screws.<\/li><li>Test the latch by opening and closing the gate to ensure smooth operation.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Apply Protective Coatings<\/h3><ul><li>Use a wood preservative, stain, or paint to protect your redwood gate from weathering.<\/li><li>Focus on exposed edges, as they are most vulnerable to damage.<\/li><li>Apply <strong>two coats<\/strong> for added protection, allowing the first coat to dry completely before applying the second.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Step 7: Maintain Your Gate<\/strong><\/h2><p>To keep your gate in excellent condition, perform regular maintenance:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Realignment:<\/strong> If the gate becomes misaligned, check the stability of the posts and adjust the hinges.<\/li><li><strong>Prevent Sagging:<\/strong> Install a diagonal brace or anti-sag kit to reinforce the structure.<\/li><li><strong>Lubricate Hardware:<\/strong> Clean and lubricate hinges and latches regularly to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><h2><strong>Step 6: Finishing Touches<\/strong><\/h2><p>Cut the boards to fit neatly around windows, doors, and other openings. Add trims or corner mouldings for a polished, professional finish.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 7: Protect Your Timber<\/strong><\/h2><p>To maintain your cladding’s beauty and durability, apply a protective finish such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ruby-group.co.uk\/collections\/osmo-cladding-stains\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">oil<\/span><\/a>, stain, or paint. This will help preserve the timber’s colour, prevent cracking, and guard against weathering.<\/p><h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2><p>By following these seven steps, you can confidently install your redwood entrance gate, adding both charm and security to your property.
