Ensure the surface is ready<\/strong>: Wood must be clean, dry, and frost-free, with a moisture content of no more than 18%.<\/p><p><strong>2. Prepare the product<\/strong>: Osmo TopOil is ready to use. Do not thin it, and stir thoroughly before application.<\/p><p><strong>3. Remove old finishes<\/strong>: Clean old microporous stains thoroughly and completely strip old paints or lacquers. Always wear a dust mask during sanding to avoid inhaling dust.<\/p><p><strong>4. Fill imperfections<\/strong>: Use Osmo Wood Filler to fill small cracks, larger joints, or holes in the wood.<\/p><p><strong>5. Sand the surface<\/strong>: Start with coarse sandpaper and progress to finer grades. For furniture, we recommend P150–P240<\/p><p><strong>6. Special care for dark and rich woods<\/strong>: For woods like Iroko, Teak, Mahogany, Cedar, or similar, use Osmo Wood Wax Finish Clear Extra Thin. A trial application is recommended to ensure the desired finish.<\/p><p><strong>7. Clean after sanding<\/strong>: Use a soft brush or vacuum cleaner to remove sanding dust completely.<\/p><p><strong>8. Trial application<\/strong>: Always test the product on a small, inconspicuous area, as the final result depends on the wood’s condition.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f3f5f6","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_gallery_hrEYiD":{"type":"image-gallery","blocks":{"image_QJW6xL":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/rubygroup_studio_furnature-339.jpg","enlarge_image":false,"link":"","title":"Before Top Coat","text":"","button_label":"","overlay_position":"center-center"}},"image_3x8bKQ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/rubygroup_studio_furnature-334.jpg","enlarge_image":false,"link":"","title":"After Top Coat","text":"","button_label":"","overlay_position":"center-center"}}},"block_order":["image_QJW6xL","image_3x8bKQ"],"settings":{"grid":2,"image_height":300,"image_height_mobile":300,"enable_margin":true,"enable_carousel":true,"overlay_style":"box","color_overlay_bg":"#ffffff","overlay_opacity":80,"color_overlay_text":"#333333","overlay_url_style":"button_1"}},"rich_text_DLGTHg":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"Application Method","text":"<p>To apply Osmo TopOil, start by applying the first coat thinly along the wood grain using the Oil Finish Application Fleece supplied with the kit. <\/p><p>After spreading the oil evenly, wipe away any excess using a clean, dry, lint-free cloth. Allow the first coat to dry for approximately 8–10 hours in a well-ventilated space to ensure proper curing.<\/p><p>Once the first coat is dry, proceed with the second coat. Again, apply the oil thinly with the fleece applicator, ensuring the surface is evenly covered. <\/p><p>Avoid covering or using the surface during the drying and curing period. Full curing takes approximately 2–3 weeks. During this time, handle the surface carefully and avoid placing heavy objects on it.<\/p><p>For renovations, one coat is usually sufficient. Simply clean and dry the surface before applying the oil using the applicator fleece or a lint-free cloth.
