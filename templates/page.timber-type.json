The cold climate in these regions contributes to a slower growth rate, resulting in a denser, stronger wood with tightly packed growth rings. <\/p><p>This density gives Scandinavian pine its remarkable durability, setting it apart from other softwoods. Its smooth, light-coloured finish and subtle grain patterns make it highly desirable for creating warm, natural-looking furniture, particularly when finished with a protective wax.<\/p><h3>Is Scandinavian Pine a Softwood?<\/h3><p>Yes, Scandinavian pine is classified as a softwood. <\/p><p>However, due to the slow growth rate in colder climates, it has a higher density and durability compared to other softwoods. This characteristic gives it a distinct edge, making it tougher and more stable. <\/p><p>While softwoods are generally less dense than hardwoods, the strength and resilience of Scandinavian pine make it an excellent choice for furniture. Its workability and resistance to warping, shrinking, and swelling give it lasting value and beauty in handmade furniture pieces, ensuring they retain their quality for many years.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f3f5f6","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_with_text_KeQPR8":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SalcombeHallwayConsoleTable4.jpg","image_link":"","image_size":"30","image_position":"left","title":"Sustainability","text":"<p>Ruby Furniture only works with sustainably sourced Scandinavian pine.
