Regular cleaning is essential to prevent this buildup.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Rinse the cladding with a hose to remove loose dirt and debris.<\/li><li><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Use a soft brush or cloth to scrub the surface with a mixture of warm water and mild detergent. Avoid using abrasive tools or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish.<\/li><li><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow the cladding to air dry. Be sure to rinse from top to bottom to avoid streaks.<\/li><li><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> For areas with mold, mildew, or algae, apply a diluted mixture of water and white vinegar, or use a specialist cladding cleaner.<\/li><\/ul><p>Regular cleaning will keep your cladding looking fresh and help prevent long-term damage caused by grime or organic growth.<\/p><h6>2. <strong>UV Protection for Longevity<\/strong><\/h6><p>Like any exterior material, cladding is exposed to sunlight, which can cause fading, discoloration, and weakening over time. Applying a UV-protective treatment helps safeguard your cladding from the sun’s harmful rays.<\/p><p><strong>Choose a UV-protective stain or sealant:<\/strong> Look for products that offer both UV protection and water resistance. We recommend Osmo Oil, having tried and tested this ourselves.<\/p><p><strong>How to apply:<\/strong><\/p><p>1. Clean the cladding thoroughly and ensure it is dry.<\/p><p>2. Apply the UV-protective finish evenly using a brush or roller, ensuring full coverage.<\/p><p>3. Let the finish dry completely before exposure to sunlight.<\/p><p>Reapply the UV treatment every 6-12 months, depending on the exposure of the cladding to direct sunlight.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"featured_collection_KFyt7D":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Featured collection","enlarge_title":false,"link_text":"Shop now","collection":"osmo-cladding-stains","show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":3,"row_count":1,"grid_mobile":"2"}},"rich_text_V8Dhpa":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"","text":"<h6>3. <strong>Waterproofing for Longevity<\/strong><\/h6><p>Cladding is often exposed to rain and moisture, which can lead to warping, swelling, or rot if not properly protected.

Here’s what to check for:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Cracks and splits:<\/strong> These can allow moisture to seep in, potentially causing damage to the underlying structure. If you notice any, fill them with a suitable wood filler or sealant.<\/li><li><strong>Loose or damaged panels:<\/strong> Check for loose cladding boards, nails, or fasteners and secure or replace them as needed.<\/li><li><strong>Mold and mildew growth:<\/strong> Treat any areas affected by mold or mildew with a wood-safe cleaner or fungicide to prevent the issue from spreading.<\/li><\/ul><p>Inspecting your cladding every season will help you spot potential problems early and maintain its structural integrity.<\/p><h6>7. <strong>Repair and Maintenance<\/strong><\/h6><p>Timely repairs are essential for maintaining the beauty and functionality of your cladding.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fix cracks or splits:<\/strong> Use a wood filler or patching compound to repair any small cracks or splits that develop over time. Sand the area smooth once the filler dries and apply a fresh coat of stain or oil.<\/li><li><strong>Replace damaged panels:<\/strong> If a section of cladding becomes severely damaged, it’s best to replace the affected panel.
