Here’s how to clean it effectively:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Remove any leaves, debris, or cobwebs using a broom or soft brush.<\/li><li><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Mix a solution of mild soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they can damage the wood or the finish.<\/li><li><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Use a soft sponge or cloth to gently scrub the wooden surfaces.<\/li><li><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Rinse thoroughly with a hose, making sure to remove all soap residue.<\/li><li><strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Allow the structure to air dry completely before applying any further treatments.<\/li><\/ul><p>Regular cleaning prevents the buildup of dirt, mould, and mildew, which can degrade the wood over time.<\/p><h6>2. <strong>UV Protection for Longevity<\/strong><\/h6><p>Like any outdoor wooden structure, pergolas and gazebos are exposed to the sun’s UV rays, which can cause the wood to fade and weaken over time. Applying a UV-protective treatment is key to preserving the wood.<\/p><p><strong>Choose a UV-protective stain or sealant:<\/strong> Look for products that offer both UV protection and water resistance. We recommend Osmo Oil, having tried and tested this ourselves.<\/p><p><strong>How to apply:<\/strong><\/p><p>1. Clean the structure thoroughly and let it dry.<\/p><p>2. Apply the UV treatment with a brush or roller, ensuring even coverage.<\/p><p>3.

Here’s how to prepare your pergola or gazebo for the colder months:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Clear away debris:<\/strong> Before winter sets in, clear off any debris from the roof or beams to prevent moisture buildup.<\/li><li><strong>Cover the structure:<\/strong> If possible, use a breathable cover to protect your pergola or gazebo from snow and ice.
