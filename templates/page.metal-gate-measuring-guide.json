Whether you're looking for a driveway gate, garden gate, or side entrance gate, taking precise measurements ensures a seamless installation. This guide will walk you through the process of measuring for your new metal gate, helping you avoid costly mistakes and ensuring a perfect fit.<\/p><h3>You'll Need:<\/h3><p>Before you start measuring, gather the following:<\/p><ul><li>A <strong>tape measure<\/strong> (preferably a long one for wide spaces)<\/li><li>A <strong>spirit level<\/strong> to check for slopes<br\/><\/li><li>A <strong>helper<\/strong> (for wider gates, a second person can be useful)<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Measuring for a Driveway Gate<\/strong><\/h2><h3><strong>Step 1: Measure the Opening Width<\/strong><\/h3><p>Measure the distance between the two posts or pillars where the gate will be installed. Take three measurements: one at the top, one at the middle, and one at the bottom. <strong>Use the smallest measurement<\/strong> to ensure the gate fits correctly.<\/p><h3><strong>Step 2: Measure the Height<\/strong><\/h3><p>Decide how tall you want your gate to be. Standard heights range from 3ft to 6ft. If installing between existing posts or walls, measure from the ground up to where the gate will sit.<\/p><h3><strong>Step 3: Consider Ground Levels<\/strong><\/h3><p>Use a spirit level to check if the ground is level. If there is a slope, you may need to adjust the gate design or install a sloped bottom edge to allow proper operation.<\/p><h3><strong>Step 4: Check for Obstructions<\/strong><\/h3><p>Look for anything that could interfere with gate operation, such as overhanging branches, drainage systems, or uneven ground. Ensure there is enough clearance for the gate to open fully.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"featured_collection_KFyt7D":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Metal Driveway Gates","enlarge_title":false,"link_text":"Shop now","collection":"metal-driveway-gates","show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":3,"row_count":1,"grid_mobile":"2"}},"rich_text_V8Dhpa":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"The step-by-step","text":"<h2><strong>Measuring for a Pedestrian or Side Gate<\/strong><\/h2><h3><strong>Step 1: Measure the Opening Width<\/strong><\/h3><p>Take three measurements—top, middle, and bottom—and record the narrowest one. Side gates are often installed between brick walls, fences, or existing posts, so precision is key.<\/p><h3><strong>Step 2: Measure the Height<\/strong><\/h3><p>Decide on the height based on privacy and security needs. Standard side gates range from 3ft to 6ft.<\/p><h3><strong>Step 3: Account for Fixtures<\/strong><\/h3><p>If your gate will be attached to existing posts or walls, note their width to ensure hinges and fittings will fit without obstruction.<\/p><h2><strong>4. Measuring for Gate Posts<\/strong><\/h2><p>If you don’t have existing posts and need to install new ones, factor in their size when measuring. Steel posts should be positioned to allow <strong>sufficient space for hinges and latches<\/strong> while ensuring structural stability.<\/p><p>Standard post sizes:<\/p><ul><li><strong>50mm square<\/strong> for lighter pedestrian gates<\/li><li><strong>70mm square<\/strong> for heavier driveway gates<\/li><\/ul><p>For freestanding gates, posts should be set <strong>one-third of their total length deep, and three times their width wide<\/strong>. For example, if your post is 1500mm long, 50mm wide, you'll need a hole at least 500mm deep with a width of 150mm to ensure proper support. This depth helps prevent movement due to weather conditions and ground shifting, keeping your gate securely in place.<\/p><h2><strong>5. Other Considerations Before Ordering<\/strong><\/h2><ul><li><strong>Opening Style:<\/strong> Decide whether your gate will swing inward or outward. Ensure there’s enough clearance for operation.<\/li><li><strong>Hinges & Latches:<\/strong> Ensure compatibility with your existing posts or order the right fittings alongside your gate.<\/li><li><strong>Automation:<\/strong> While we don’t sell automation equipment, if you plan to use an electric gate opener, ensure there is additional clearance for motors and arms. Check compatibility with your chosen gate and confirm that the mounting space allows for proper operation.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Conclusion: Get the Right Fit for Your Gate<\/strong><\/h2><p>Accurate measurements make all the difference in ensuring a smooth installation.
