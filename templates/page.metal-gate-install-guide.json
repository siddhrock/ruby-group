If you proceed with the installation and the gate isn't correct for the space, and you end up damaging or drilling through the gate, we may not be able to refund your order — you have been warned!<\/p><h3>Optional Step: Installing Gate Posts\/Replacing Old Wall Fittings<\/h3><p><strong>Installing New Gate Posts:<\/strong><\/p><ol><li>Start with digging a hole for the new posts. Remove old posts and debris, or dig fresh ones. Ideally, the depth of the holes should be around a third of the total length of the new posts to provide a solid base capable of supporting the gate's weight.<\/li><li>The width of the holes should be three times the size of the post. For example, if the post is 100mm square, dig a 300mm-wide hole. This ensures there is enough concrete to securely anchor the posts.<\/li><li>Place the posts in the holes and use a spirit level to ensure they’re perfectly straight (plumb). Support them in place if needed.<\/li><li>Mix the post mix concrete according to the brand’s instructions. Pour water into the hole, then add the concrete mix, topping up with water as necessary and mixing thoroughly.<\/li><li>Allow the concrete to set for at least 24 hours (or longer if recommended by the product instructions) before proceeding to the next step.<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>Replacing Old Wall Fittings:<\/strong><\/p><p>Replacing old wall-mounted hardware is usually straightforward: unbolt the old hinge plate and attach the new one. Be prepared for a bit of effort if the old bolts are rusty or stuck—you might need to chisel or drill out stubborn ones. Once the old hardware is removed, affix the new hinge brackets securely.<\/p><h3><\/h3><p><\/p><p><\/p><h3>Step 2: Hanging the Gate<\/h3><p>Now that your posts are nice and solid, we can start putting together our gate.<\/p><p>If you’re using existing posts, our metal gates come with pre-drilled and welded hardware, so you don’t need to install anything additional. For new posts, you’ll need to attach hinge brackets first.<\/p><ol><li><strong>Position the Gate:<\/strong> Offer up the gate to the posts, using wooden blocks or similar to set the correct ground clearance.<\/li><li><strong>Mark Hinge Locations:<\/strong> Mark the position of the middle of the eye bolts onto the posts. Use this mark to place your hinge brackets, ensuring the top of the bracket arm aligns with the bottom of the gate’s eye bolt.<\/li><li><strong>Fix the Brackets:<\/strong> Attach the hinge brackets to the posts using the supplied screws or bolts. If you’re working with steel posts, you’ll likely have Tek screws, which don’t require pre-drilling and can be screwed straight through.<\/li><li><strong>Attach the Gate:<\/strong> Thread a bolt through the bracket and the gate’s eye bolt. Secure it in place with washers and nuts. Tighten everything up, but not too much—you may need to make adjustments.<\/li><li><strong>Check Alignment:<\/strong> Use a spirit level to ensure the gate is level and swings freely without resistance. Adjust as needed by loosening or tightening the bolts.<\/li><\/ol><h3>Step 3: Installing the Catch and Latch<\/h3><p>Now that the gate is hanging securely, it’s time to install the latch and catch. This ensures the gate functions properly and stays closed when needed.<\/p><ol><li><strong>Position the Latch:<\/strong> Choose a comfortable height for the latch mechanism and hold it against the gate frame. Mark the screw holes with a pencil or marker.<\/li><li><strong>Drill Pilot Holes:<\/strong> Use a drill with the appropriate bit to create pilot holes at the marked positions. This helps avoid damaging the material when inserting screws.<\/li><li><strong>Attach the Latch:<\/strong> Secure the latch to the gate using screws, ensuring it’s firmly in place but still allows for smooth operation.<\/li><li><strong>Align the Catch Plate:<\/strong> Close the gate and align the catch plate with the latch. Mark the screw positions on the post or wall where the catch plate will be attached.<\/li><li><strong>Fix the Catch Plate:<\/strong> Drill pilot holes if necessary and attach the catch plate using screws. Ensure the latch and catch engage properly.<\/li><li><strong>Test Operation:<\/strong> Open and close the gate several times to ensure the latch works as intended. Make adjustments if needed.<\/li><\/ol><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><h3>Step 4: Final Adjustments<\/h3><p>With everything installed, follow these final steps to ensure a perfect finish:<\/p><ol><li><strong>Check for Smooth Operation:<\/strong> Open and close the gate to make sure it swings smoothly and doesn’t drag or stick. Adjust hinges if needed.<\/li><li><strong>Tighten Fixings:<\/strong> Go over all bolts, screws, and fittings to ensure they are securely fastened.<\/li><li><strong>Apply Finishing Touches:<\/strong> If the gate was scratched during installation, touch it up with paint or a rust-proof coating. Clean the gate to remove any dirt or debris from the installation process.<\/li><\/ol><h3><\/h3><h3>Maintenance Tips<\/h3><p>To keep your new metal gate looking great and functioning properly for years to come, follow these simple maintenance tips:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Inspect Regularly:<\/strong> Check the hinges, latch, and brackets for signs of wear or loosening. Tighten or replace parts as needed.<\/li><li><strong>Lubricate Moving Parts:<\/strong> Apply grease or oil to hinges and latches to keep them operating smoothly.<\/li><li><strong>Clean Periodically:<\/strong> Wash the gate with soapy water and a soft cloth to remove dirt and grime. Rinse and dry thoroughly.<\/li><li><strong>Prevent Rust:<\/strong> If your gate is exposed to the elements, apply a rust-resistant coating annually to protect it.<\/li><li><strong>Repaint as Needed:<\/strong> If the paint chips or fades, sand the affected area lightly and apply a fresh coat to maintain the gate’s appearance and durability.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_with_text_overlay_xD643B":{"type":"image-with-text-overlay","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/MAZP10-25_Manor_Ball_Top_Double_Driveway_Gate.jpg","image_link":"https:\/\/www.ruby-group.co.uk\/collections\/metal-gates","height":"fixed","height_desktop":380,"height_mobile":240,"color_overlay_bg":"#ffffff","overlay_opacity":80,"color_overlay_text":"#333333","text_alignment":"center","overlay_position_x":50,"overlay_position_y":70,"mobile_text_below":false,"overlay_title":"Shop Metal Gates","enlarge_title":false,"overlay_title_width":100,"styled_words":"","words_style":"stencil","highlight_words_top":10,"highlight_color":"#ffffff","styled_word_color":"#b5e0fa","overlay_text":"","enlarge_text":false,"overlay_url_text_1":"","overlay_url_1":"","overlay_url_text_2":"","overlay_url_2":"","overlay_url_style":"button_1","color_label_background":"#ffffff","color_label_text":"#333333","show_chevron":true,"product_id_1":"","chevron_position_1":"right","label_position_x_1":20,"label_position_y_1":30,"product_id_2":"","chevron_position_2":"right","label_position_x_2":80,"label_position_y_2":50}}},"order":["main","rich_text_prQNzh","slideshow_fJWfWq","rich_text_6nyTL6","featured_collection_KFyt7D","rich_text_V8Dhpa","image_with_text_overlay_xD643B"]}
