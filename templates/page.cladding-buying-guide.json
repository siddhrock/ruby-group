Start here:","text":"<p>When picking your new timber cladding, it’s all about finding the right balance between cost, durability, and appearance. If longevity is your main concern, Accoya is a fantastic choice. While it’s on the pricier side, it offers unmatched durability with a lifespan of over 50 years and a pale, smooth appearance that can be stained or left to weather naturally to a silvery-gray.<\/p><p>For a mid-range option, European Larch is a popular pick. With warm golden tones and a lifespan of 20-30 years, it’s a reliable and visually appealing choice that won’t break the bank. If you’re looking for something a little more luxurious, Iroko stands out. This rich, golden-brown hardwood lasts 40-50 years and brings a premium feel to any project, though it does come with a higher price tag.<\/p><p>For budget-conscious projects, Radiata Pine Thermowood and Redwood Thermowood are excellent options. Both are affordable and offer a lifespan of 15-25 years. Radiata Pine features light brown tones that darken over time, while Redwood has soft reddish-brown hues that weather to gray, offering slightly different aesthetics.<\/p><p>Finally, Western Red Cedar is a versatile option that strikes a balance between durability and beauty. With a lifespan of 30-40 years, its naturally rich reddish-brown tones fade gracefully to a silvery-gray, making it a favorite for both contemporary and classic designs.<\/p><p>Ultimately, your choice will depend on your priorities. For the best durability and performance, Accoya and Iroko are clear winners. For a warm, natural look, European Larch and Western Red Cedar deliver. And for those working within a budget, Radiata Pine and Redwood Thermowood provide excellent value without compromising style.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#ecf1f2","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"custom_collapsible_tabs_y4Tgr6":{"type":"custom_collapsible_tabs","blocks":{"question_dDMTR7":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Shadow Gap","answer":"<p>Shadow profile boards create a unique visual effect by casting a shadow along the joints when installed, which enhances the geometric appearance of the exterior or interior surfaces. <\/p><p>This profile is especially popular in contemporary architecture for its ability to add depth and dimension to flat surfaces. <\/p><p>Its design is straightforward yet highly effective in creating striking visual patterns that are both modern and sophisticated.<\/p>","image_text":"<ul><li><strong>Visual Appeal<\/strong>: The angled cuts create dynamic shadows that give the surface a three-dimensional look, increasing visual interest.<\/li><li><strong>Durability:<\/strong> Designed for both interior and exterior use, its sturdy construction withstands environmental elements well.<\/li><li><strong>Contemporary Design:<\/strong> Ideal for modern architectural designs, the shadow profile contributes to a clean, avant-garde aesthetic.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Pressure_Treated_Redwood_Shadow_Gap_6.jpg","button":"Shop Shadow Gap Cladding","button_url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/ruby-uk-contemporary-cedar-slatted-fences"}},"question_LTEpaA":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Loglap","answer":"<p>Loglap cladding is designed to give the aesthetic appeal of a log cabin, featuring boards that have a curved profile to resemble logs. <\/p><p>This type of cladding is used primarily on exteriors and provides the appearance of solid logs while utilising less material, making it more cost-effective and easier to install. <\/p><p>Loglap offers a charming, traditional look and is often chosen for its robust, natural appearance.<\/p>","image_text":"<ul><li><strong>Rustic Appeal:<\/strong> Loglap mimics the traditional log cabin style, adding rustic charm to buildings without the need for full logs.<\/li><li><strong>Lightweight:<\/strong> Despite its robust appearance, loglap is easier to manipulate and install than actual logs.<\/li><li><strong>Insulation:<\/strong> The thickness and overlap of loglap boards contribute to better thermal insulation, enhancing energy efficiency.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Loglap_Treated_Redwood_119mm_x_21mm_4.jpg","button":"Shop Loglap Cladding","button_url":"shopify:\/\/products\/loglap"}},"question_aEPRgj":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Shiplap","answer":"<p>Shiplap siding consists of wooden boards designed to interlock in a way that forms a tight seal, which is particularly useful for exterior applications.
