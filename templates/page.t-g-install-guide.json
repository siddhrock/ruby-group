Assuming you're good to go, this is the time to attach your weatherproof membrane. You can temporarily put it up with tape, before affixing it properly with galvanised staples, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ruby-group.co.uk\/collections\/cladding-accessories-1\/products\/50mm-nails\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">nails<\/span><\/a> or screws with washers.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 2: Install the Battens<\/strong><\/h2><p>Treated timber battens provide the foundation for your cladding.<\/p><ol><li>Measure and mark where the battens will go. For horizontal cladding, position them vertically; for vertical cladding, position them horizontally.<\/li><li>Space the battens evenly, around 400–600mm apart. Ensure additional battens are placed at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ruby-group.co.uk\/collections\/cladding-corner-trim\"> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">corners<\/span><\/a>, window edges, and joints for extra support.<\/li><li>Secure the battens to the wall using screws or fixings appropriate for your wall type.<\/li><\/ol><h2><strong>Step 3: Prep the T&G Boards<\/strong><\/h2><p>Inspect your T&G boards to ensure they are free of defects. It helps if the boards are acclimated to site conditions, so leaving them outside (but covered) for 5-7 days is a good idea. This allows the wood to do most of its moving before we add any weak-points in the way of holes. Cut them to the required length, leaving a 2mm gap at edges to allow for expansion. Remember that wood is a natural, breathable material and so will be affected by the weather and time of year, so this step is crucial.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 4: Start Cladding<\/strong><\/h2><p>Now it’s time to start attaching the boards!<\/p><ul><li>Begin at the bottom for horizontal cladding or one side for vertical cladding.<\/li><li>For horizontal cladding, position the groove edge downward to prevent water ingress.<\/li><li>Use a spirit level to ensure your first board is perfectly straight.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Step 5: Fix the Boards<\/strong><\/h2><p>Secure each board with screws or nails, ensuring a snug fit between the tongue and groove. For a seamless look, fix through the tongue (hidden fixing) or use face-fixing where preferred. Slide the next board into place and repeat the process.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 6: Finishing Touches<\/strong><\/h2><p>Cut the boards to fit neatly around windows, doors, and other openings. Add trims or corner mouldings for a polished, professional finish.<\/p><h2><strong>Step 7: Protect Your Timber<\/strong><\/h2><p>To maintain your cladding’s beauty and durability, apply a protective finish such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ruby-group.co.uk\/collections\/osmo-cladding-stains\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">oil<\/span><\/a>, stain, or paint. This will help preserve the timber’s colour, prevent cracking, and guard against weathering.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_with_text_overlay_xD643B":{"type":"image-with-text-overlay","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IRO_Cladding_1.png","image_link":"","height":"fixed","height_desktop":380,"height_mobile":240,"color_overlay_bg":"#ffffff","overlay_opacity":80,"color_overlay_text":"#333333","text_alignment":"center","overlay_position_x":50,"overlay_position_y":70,"mobile_text_below":false,"overlay_title":"","enlarge_title":false,"overlay_title_width":100,"styled_words":"","words_style":"stencil","highlight_words_top":10,"highlight_color":"#ffffff","styled_word_color":"#b5e0fa","overlay_text":"","enlarge_text":false,"overlay_url_text_1":"","overlay_url_1":"","overlay_url_text_2":"","overlay_url_2":"","overlay_url_style":"button_1","color_label_background":"#ffffff","color_label_text":"#333333","show_chevron":true,"product_id_1":"","chevron_position_1":"right","label_position_x_1":20,"label_position_y_1":30,"product_id_2":"","chevron_position_2":"right","label_position_x_2":80,"label_position_y_2":50}}},"order":["main","rich_text_prQNzh","slideshow_fJWfWq","rich_text_6nyTL6","featured_collection_KFyt7D","rich_text_V8Dhpa","image_with_text_overlay_xD643B"]}
