However, there are a few important things to note:</p><ul><li><strong>Access Requirements</strong>: Please inform us at the time of purchase if your property has restricted access, such as narrow staircases, limited parking, or height restrictions for delivery vehicles. This helps us plan accordingly.</li><li><strong>Room of Choice</strong>: For furniture deliveries, we aim to deliver your items to your preferred room whenever possible. However, if access is severely restricted, the delivery team may only be able to leave the items at a suitable ground-floor location for safety reasons.</li><li><strong>Preparation</strong>: To avoid any issues, we recommend measuring doorways, staircases, and lifts in advance to ensure the items can fit. If you’re unsure, our team can provide dimensions of the furniture to help you check.</li><li><strong>Alternative Solutions</strong>: If access is particularly challenging, we may be able to offer alternative delivery solutions, such as a smaller delivery vehicle or additional delivery personnel for larger items (additional fees may apply). Please contact us to discuss your options.</li></ul><p>For any concerns about access or special delivery requirements, our team is here to help! <a href=\"/pages/contact-us-1\" title=\"Contact Us - Ruby UK\">Contact us</a> in advance so we can ensure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible.</p>",
