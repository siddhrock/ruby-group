Its design helps protect against the elements by providing excellent water runoff, making it ideal for outdoor applications.

This will act as a moisture barrier and promote ventilation.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 2: Install the Battens<\/strong><\/h3><p>Treated timber battens are essential for creating a framework to support your cladding.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Measure and mark:<\/strong> Position vertical battens for horizontal shiplap cladding.<\/li><li><strong>Spacing:<\/strong> Space battens 400–600mm apart and add extra battens around windows, doors, and corners for reinforcement.<\/li><li><strong>Secure battens:<\/strong> Use screws or fixings suitable for your wall type to firmly attach them.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 3: Prepare the Shiplap Boards<\/strong><\/h3><ul><li><strong>Inspect your boards:<\/strong> Check for any defects and allow the boards to acclimate to site conditions for 5–7 days. This minimises movement after installation.<\/li><li><strong>Cut to size:<\/strong> Use a saw to cut the boards to the required length, leaving a 2mm gap at edges for expansion.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 4: Start Cladding<\/strong><\/h3><p>Now you’re ready to begin installing the boards!<\/p><ul><li><strong>Start at the bottom:<\/strong> For horizontal shiplap, begin with the first board at the base of the wall.<\/li><li><strong>Position correctly:<\/strong> Ensure the overlap of the boards faces downward to shed water.<\/li><li><strong>Check alignment:<\/strong> Use a spirit level to ensure the first board is perfectly straight.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 5: Fix the Boards<\/strong><\/h3><ul><li><strong>Secure the first board:<\/strong> Fix the board to the battens using stainless steel screws or nails. Place the fixings through the overlapping edge for a discreet finish.<\/li><li><strong>Overlap and repeat:<\/strong> Install the next board so it overlaps the first, creating a consistent shadow line. Repeat until the wall is covered.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 6: Finishing Touches<\/strong><\/h3><ul><li><strong>Cut to fit:<\/strong> Neatly trim boards around windows, doors, and other openings for a polished look.<\/li><li><strong>Add trims and mouldings:<\/strong> Use corner trims and edge mouldings to give the installation a professional finish.<\/li><\/ul><h3><strong>Step 7: Protect Your Timber<\/strong><\/h3><p>To enhance the durability and appearance of your shiplap cladding:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Apply a protective finish:<\/strong> Use an oil, stain, or paint to preserve the timber’s natural colour and protect against weathering.<\/li><li><strong>Reapply as needed:<\/strong> Regular maintenance will keep your cladding looking great for years to come.<\/li><\/ul>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"image_with_text_overlay_xD643B":{"type":"image-with-text-overlay","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IRO_Cladding_1.png","image_link":"","height":"fixed","height_desktop":380,"height_mobile":240,"color_overlay_bg":"#ffffff","overlay_opacity":80,"color_overlay_text":"#333333","text_alignment":"center","overlay_position_x":50,"overlay_position_y":70,"mobile_text_below":false,"overlay_title":"","enlarge_title":false,"overlay_title_width":100,"styled_words":"","words_style":"stencil","highlight_words_top":10,"highlight_color":"#ffffff","styled_word_color":"#b5e0fa","overlay_text":"","enlarge_text":false,"overlay_url_text_1":"","overlay_url_1":"","overlay_url_text_2":"","overlay_url_2":"","overlay_url_style":"button_1","color_label_background":"#ffffff","color_label_text":"#333333","show_chevron":true,"product_id_1":"","chevron_position_1":"right","label_position_x_1":20,"label_position_y_1":30,"product_id_2":"","chevron_position_2":"right","label_position_x_2":80,"label_position_y_2":50}}},"order":["main","rich_text_prQNzh","slideshow_fJWfWq","rich_text_6nyTL6","featured_collection_KFyt7D","rich_text_V8Dhpa","image_with_text_overlay_xD643B"]}
