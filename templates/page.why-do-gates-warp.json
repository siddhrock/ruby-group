Pre-Installation: Dry Storage<\/strong><\/h6><p>Before installing wooden driveway gates, it’s crucial to store them correctly. Place the gates in a dry location for a minimum of 72 hours on a completely level surface. This time is to allow the timber to adjust to its environment, reducing the risk of warping or bending post-installation.<\/p><h6><strong>2. UV Protection for Longevity<\/strong><\/h6><p>Before installing or immediately after apply a UV-resistant stain or oil to the gates. This treatment acts as a barrier, protecting the wood from harmful UV rays and rapidly changing moisture levels. Many of these products require regular reapplication, see manufacturer's instructions.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f1f3f4","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"featured_product_bEeKDh":{"type":"featured-product","settings":{"product":"uv-protection-oil","image_size":"30","description":"<p>Seal your timber today with quality UV protection!<\/p>","show_vendor":false,"url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"section_text_colour":"#333333","color_bg":"#ffffff","gradient_bg":"","enable_video_looping":false,"layout":"image_before"}},"rich_text_V8Dhpa":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"","text":"<h6><strong>3. Securing the Gate to Prevent Twisting<\/strong><\/h6><p>All gates must be secured at both the top and bottom to prevent twisting or warping over time. When installing single or double gates, it's crucial to use a drop bolt at the bottom of each gate leaf and a top fastening system to ensure stability. For double gates, use a drop bolt on each gate leaf and a throwover loop at the top to securely fasten both gate leaves together. This system ensures both gates stay aligned and prevents them from twisting or misaligning over time.<\/p><h6><strong>4. Drop Bolts for Double Gates<\/strong><\/h6><p>As mentioned, if you're installing double gates, it’s essential to use a drop bolt per gate leaf, paired with a top fastening system like a throwover loop.

Even Treatment to Avoid Warping<\/strong><\/h6><p>When applying stain or oil, it’s critical to treat both sides of the gate evenly. Avoid applying the finish to one side and letting it dry before treating the other. Uneven drying creates surface tension that can lead to warping as the untreated side absorbs moisture. By applying the stain to both sides in succession, you maintain balance in the wood’s moisture absorption.<\/p><h6><strong>6. Proper Application Technique<\/strong><\/h6><p>Always apply any protective stain or oil in the direction of the wood grain. This method ensures that the treatment is absorbed evenly and enhances the natural beauty of the wood. Applying against the grain can lead to blotchy finishes and inconsistent protection.<\/p><h6><strong>7. End Grain Protection<\/strong><\/h6><p>The end grain of the wood is particularly vulnerable to moisture, which can cause it to absorb water quickly. This leads to swelling and potential damage. Pay special attention to coating the end grain thoroughly during the staining or oiling process to ensure it remains sealed and protected.<\/p><h6><strong>8. Don't Forget the Bottom Edge<\/strong><\/h6><p>One of the most commonly overlooked areas during treatment is the bottom edge of the gate. Leaving this area untreated allows moisture to be absorbed from the ground, which can result in swelling, rotting, and eventual breakdown of the gate. Modern wood treatments are designed to protect all surfaces while allowing the wood to breathe, so ensure the bottom edge is properly sealed.<\/p><h6><strong>9. Hinge Specifications<\/strong><\/h6><p>Choosing the right hinges is just as important as any other part of the installation. Here are some guidelines:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tee Hinges<\/strong> should be at least half the width of the gate to provide adequate support.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Bands and Hooks<\/strong> should be one-third the width of the gate to ensure long-term stability and ease of movement.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f3f5f6","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"product_list_ECDEhy":{"type":"product-list","settings":{"title":"Tee Hinges & Band and Hooks","enlarge_title":false,"link_text":"","link_url":"","product_list":["strong-tee-hinges-various-sizes","medium-tee-hinges-various-sizes","paid-of-adjustable-24-bands-and-hooks"],"show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":3,"grid_mobile":"2"}},"rich_text_qRDgtD":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"","text":"<h6><strong>10. Natural Cracks and Splits<\/strong><\/h6><p>It’s important to remember that cracks and splits in the wood are a natural part of its maturing process. As temperature and humidity levels fluctuate, the wood expands and contracts, which can cause these cracks and splits to develop. This is a normal reaction and should not be a cause for concern.
