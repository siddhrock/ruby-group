In this process, the wood is submerged in a tank filled with preservative chemicals, allowing the treatment to coat the outer layers. While this method provides an initial layer of defence against rot, decay, and discolouration, the protection is relatively superficial. <\/p><p>Over time, as the surface treatment wears off, the wood becomes vulnerable to the elements, requiring frequent maintenance and reapplication of preservatives to maintain its effectiveness. Dip-treated timber is often chosen for smaller projects or where budget constraints are a primary concern, but it may not be the best option for long-term durability.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Dip Treated vs. Pressure Treated<\/h4><h4><\/h4><p>In contrast, pressure-treated timber undergoes a far more rigorous and effective preservation process. The wood is placed in a pressurised chamber where preservatives are forced deep into the wood fibres.  This ensures that the treatment penetrates far beyond the surface, providing thorough protection against rot, decay, and discolouration —even in the most challenging environments. <\/p><p>Pressure Treatment is particularly well-suited for outdoor and ground-contact applications, where exposure to moisture and weather conditions can quickly degrade untreated or superficially treated wood.<\/p><p><strong>Unlike most Sheds are on the market, <\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>our Sheds are pressure-treated<\/strong><\/span> to ensure longevity.<\/p><p><\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","vertical_alignment":"center","url_style":"button_1","enlarge_title":false,"enlarge_text":false,"full_width":false,"color_title":"#333333","color_text":"#333333","color_bg":"#f3f5f6","gradient_bg":"","custom_padding":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"collapsible_tabs_FmHHtc":{"type":"collapsible-tabs","blocks":{"question_VeVhhV":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Deep, Long-Lasting Protection","answer":"<p>Our pressure-treated timber is thoroughly treated to protect against the harshest conditions, ensuring your timber remains strong and intact for years to come.<\/p>"}},"question_MKe4EC":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Low Maintenance:","answer":"<p>With Ruby UK’s pressure-treated timber, you won’t have to worry about frequent maintenance.
